The 3 little pigs

there were three little pigs who lived in their own houses. One pig lived in a house made of sticks. Another lived in a house made of hay. The last pig lived in a house made of bricks. There was a evil wolf who wanted to eat the pigs so he comes near the first pigs house.
The first pig hides inside his stick house. The wolf huffs and puffs and blowes the pigs house away. The pig runs away to the second pigs house which is made of hay. The wolf comes to the second pigs house and huffs and puffs and blows his house away. The 2 pigs then
run to the third pigs house made of bricks. The wolf chases them and huffs and puffs and blows the third pigs house but it didnt collapse. He huffs and puffs and tries again and again but the house remains untouched. The angry wolf then walks away in defeat.
